Bridging vs. Routing


Bridging and routing are functionally very similar, with the major
difference being that a routed VPN will not pass IP broadcasts
while a bridged VPN will.

Routing
=======
Overall, routing is probably a better choice for most people,
as it is more efficient and easier to set up (as far as the
OpenVPN configuration itself) than bridging.  Routing also
provides a greater ability to selectively control access
rights on a client-specific basis.

I would recommend using routing unless you need a specific
feature which requires bridging, such as:

o the VPN needs to be able to handle non-IP protocols such as IPX,

o you are running applications over the VPN which rely on network
  broadcasts (such as LAN games), or

o you would like to allow browsing of Windows file shares across
  the VPN without setting up a Samba or WINS server.

Routed OpenVPN configurations are useful if the machine running
the OpenVPN server is the same machine which is serving as the
LAN's gateway. ... Another significant benefit of bridging over
routing is that Ethernet bridging passes all Ethernet network
traffic whereas IP routing only handles "directed" IP packet
traffic.
