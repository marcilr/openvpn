OpenVPN - Open Source VPN


Would like to be able to access the home network from UAA ITS debian lenny
boothite workstation.  Think that IP encapsulation using openvpn may be the
best route to go.  Linux Journal has had a series of articles on openvpn that
are promising.

=============================
Last night worked on openvpn client export instation on pfSense.  Initial install
of version 1.x was easy.  It advised that a newwer 2.x was available.

Inspection of the "client export" tab indicated that the openvpn server
needed to be installed 1st.

Per dicussion with John Millican at GCI the order of installation operations
is:

1. Configure users
2. Install openvpn server
3. Do "client export" to get configuration file (?)

=============================
OpenVPN use with pfSense

Had good discussion with GCI NMS John Millican regarding pfSense openvpn.

There are a few components required for this:

1. In pfSense install the openvpn client export package.  This will create
   the "client export" tab for openvpn use.

2. Install openvpn package on remote debian server.  On debian jessie
   8.6 amd64 this looks like:
     openvpn - virtual private network daemon

3. Configure the remote *.ovpn file with the public ip of the pfSense box
   running the openvpn client.
