Bridging vs. Routing


Routed OpenVPN configurations are useful if the machine running
the OpenVPN server is the same machine which is serving as the
LAN's gateway. ... Another significant benefit of bridging over
routing is that Ethernet bridging passes all Ethernet network
traffic whereas IP routing only handles "directed" IP packet
traffic.
