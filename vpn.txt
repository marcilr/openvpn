Virtual private network (VPN)


A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
network, such as the Internet.  It enables a computer to send and receive data
across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the
private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and
management policies of the private network.
