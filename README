  Virtual private network (VPN)

  A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across
  a public network, such as the Internet.  It enables a computer
  to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if
  it were directly connected to the private network, while
  benefiting from the functionality, security and management
  policies of the private network.
