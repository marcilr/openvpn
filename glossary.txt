Glossary for vpn


pptp - The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a method for
  implementing virtual private networks.  It works on Data link layer
  (#2 layer) on TCP/IP model.  Personally I prefer IPSEC.  PPTP Client is a
  Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD client for the proprietary Microsoft
  Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, PPTP.  Allows connection to a PPTP based
  Virtual Private Network (VPN) as used by employers and some cable and ADSL
  internet service providers.

vpn - Virtual private network
  A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a
  public network, such as the Internet.  It enables a computer to send
  and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directl
  connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality,
  security and management policies of the private network.
